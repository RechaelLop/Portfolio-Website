                <h2>Community Service</h2>
                <p>As a part of my bachelor's program, I was working as an Administrative Volunteer for elderly care home A1 Snehanjali. 
                    I have performed various administrative tasks such as handling office work, answering phone calls, 
                    making appointments, maintaining a calendar, and keeping records. I have worked with Excel and other tools, 
                    digital entries, and generating reports. One of the most exciting aspects was engaging in recreational activities 
                    with the residents, including art sessions, music learning, outdoor sports, organizing public events, outings, etc.

                <h2>Health Checkup Camp</h2>
                <p>While working at the elderly care center, we organized various camps including a Health Checkup Camp 
                    for remote villagers. We have called upon a specialized team of doctors. The camp was set for an entire day
                    and had arrangements made for the public. We had even done a promotional event to ensure the majority 
                    of people took advantage of such camps. Apart from this, we had also arranged Blood Donation and Organ Awarness Camps.
